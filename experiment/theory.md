### Introduction
<br>
GPS observations are based on the basic principle of trilateration. Trilateration, which literally means positioning from three distances. A global positioning system (GPS) device uses data from satellites to locate a specific point on the Earth in a process called trilateration. To trilaterate, a GPS receiver measures the distances to satellites using radio signals.<br>
This experiment is useful to study of GPS and its accessories.
